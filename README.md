# TagRSS

Extremely simple RSS reader with support for tags, which can be applied to multiple feeds.

This project is not in a finished state, but the core functionality is present.

## To do

* Add filtering by tag/feed
* Do more user input validation
* Handle more `requests` and `feedparser` error conditions
* Add logging
* Add some reasonably high internal limit on tag count
* Add support for authentication
* Allow specifying update interval on a per-feed basis
